# Patio Environment Sensor Mount

This models "clamps" an Aqara temperature, humidity, and pressure sensor (model WSDCGQ11LM) to the underside of the upper sill outside my patio door.

This model currently works fine, but it is a little loose on the clamping. It's more of a balance bar for the sensor than a clamp.

Additionally, the clamp/balance bar could do with being a touch longer. In its current form, I worry the sensor may be dripped on from the bricks above.

Drips aren't a huge worry, the sensor survived just fine being sat in direct rain and sunlight for months on end. The only issue is direct exposure to rain really throws off the humidity readings.
